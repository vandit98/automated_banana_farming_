## What it does
It allows automacy in the farming process and reduce the labour cost,time and increase the production within the same land.

## How we built it
The project tackled the challenges of feeding a growing population sustainably using technologies like Pygame, NumPy, and CNN. Deep reinforcement learning and the YOLOv3 algorithm were implemented, while leveraging ,Spheron,FastAPI, and React.js. 



## Who will get benefit
A large sector of people including:

Farmers
Consumers
Agricultural Industry
Economies of Banana-Producing Regions
Environmental Conservation

## Challenges we ran into
During the development of the project, several challenges were encountered. The initial hurdle was learning and becoming familiar with Pygame, a Python library for game development. This involved overcoming the learning curve and understanding the framework, which required time and effort.

Another significant challenge was the limited time available to develop a refined idea within 24 hours. Striking a balance between project complexity and time constraints required careful planning and prioritization.

Implementing deep reinforcement learning was a complex task, as it involved understanding the principles and algorithms of reinforcement learning and effectively integrating them into the project.

Achieving high accuracy in banana classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proved demanding. Training the CNN to reach a 98 percent accuracy rate necessitated extensive training, data preprocessing, and fine-tuning of the model.

These challenges highlight the need for perseverance, careful planning, and continuous learning throughout the development process.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have succesfully executed the project and have a final mvp with us.

## What we learned
A lot new mainly about neat cars and deep reinforcement learning.

## What's next for Automatic_Banana_Farming
We will try creating a hardware prototype in minimal cost and find potential investors. We also aim to extend to several crops as well.
